                    Steve Rogers leads the newly formed team of Avengers in their continued efforts to safeguard
                    humanity.
                    But after another incident involving the Avengers results in collateral damage, political pressure
                    mounts to install a system of accountability, headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the
                    team.
                    <br><br>
                    The new status quo fractures the Avengers, resulting in two camps—one led by Steve Rogers and his
                    desirefor the Avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference, and the
                    other
                    following Tony Stark’s surprising decision to support government oversight and accountability.

                <p class="text">
                    Genius. Billionaire. Philanthropist. Tony Stark's confidence is only matched by his high-flying
                    abilities as the hero called Iron Man.
                    <br><br>
                    Genius inventor Tony Stark continued his father Howard Stark’s weaponry business after his parents’
                    untimely deaths and flew it to even greater heights of innovation. While in Afghanistan to
                    demonstrate a
                    new missile for the U.S. military, Stark’s convoy came under fire by a terrorist group known as the
                    Ten
                    Rings and he was severely wounded.
                    <br><br>
                    Taken prisoner by the group, Stark awoke in their headquarters to learn that shrapnel near his heart
                    had
                    nearly cost him his life, but swift action by scientist and fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen—who had
                    inserted a
                    powerful electromagnet in Stark’s chest—would prolong it temporarily.

                    Recipient of the Super Soldier serum, World War II hero Steve Rogers fights for American ideals as
                    one of the world’s mightiest heroes and the leader of the Avengers.
                    <br><br>
                    Envious of his friend Bucky Barnes’ military enlistment, and undeterred by his own multiple
                    rejections
                    by the U.S. Army, physical weakling Steve Rogers made one more attempt to join the march of men to
                    fight
                    for their country in the dark days of World War II.
                    <br><br>
                    Rogers’ valiant wish to fight bullies wherever they were grabbed the attention of scientist Dr.
                    Abraham Erskine, and he handpicked the idealistic young man for the Army’s Super-Soldier program
                    under his supervision.

                    T’Challa is the king of the secretive and highly advanced African nation of Wakanda - as well as the
                    powerful warrior known as the Black Panther.
                    <br><br>
                    A native of the small, yet technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda, T’Challa accepted the
                    mantle of Black Panther, the legendary protector of the Wakandan people, from his father, King
                    T’Chaka,
                    who filled the role before him as his father before him and so on.
                    <br><br>
                    T’Chaka relinquished the title as he
                    grew older and delved further into politics. This was a subject T’Challa looked upon with some
                    dislike,
                    although he acknowledged the increasing importance of it, even as Wakanda maintained an air of
                    secrecy
                    to hide its true nature and precious vibranium mines.
